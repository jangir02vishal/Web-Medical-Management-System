# Medical Center Management System

This GitHub repository hosts the source code and documentation for a comprehensive web-based Medical Center Management System tailored for a Medical Center. The existing manual system at the Medical Centre has prompted the need for an efficient and automated solution to manage patient demography, prescriptions, medicine distribution, and overall medical center operations.

## Problem Statement
The current manual system relies heavily on paper-based processes, leading to time-consuming tasks for doctors and staff. This project addresses the challenges by automating tasks such as prescribing medication, maintaining medicine stock, and retrieving patient records, aiming to streamline operations and enhance efficiency.

## Project Overview
This system offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing various aspects, including patient prescriptions, medicine distribution, and stock maintenance. Accessible both within the Medical Center's terminals and over the internet, it enables patients to view their prescriptions remotely. The project aims to modernize and optimize medical center operations.
